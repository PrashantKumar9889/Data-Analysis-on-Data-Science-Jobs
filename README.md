### **Data Analysis on Data Science Jobs**

---

#### **Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the data science job market, focusing on key factors such as salary, job titles, years, locations, company sizes, experience levels, and work modes. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncover trends, patterns, and insights to guide job seekers and industry stakeholders in making informed decisions.
